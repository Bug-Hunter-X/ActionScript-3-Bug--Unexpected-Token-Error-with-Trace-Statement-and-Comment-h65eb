This repository contains an example of a rare ActionScript 3 bug involving an unexpected token error that occurs when a trace statement is immediately followed by a comment within a function. The bug is demonstrated in the 'bug.as' file and a solution is provided in 'bugSolution.as'.  The bug only seems to manifest in some specific code contexts, and the root cause appears to be related to how the compiler parses the code under these conditions.  The solution involves minor code restructuring to avoid the problem.
